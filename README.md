## ProgrammingHub
For the benefit of programmers.

### If you are looking for a public repository to contribute. This is the place to be!

#### Contribute to Open source and make the world a better place. You can create new folders if you want to. But take special care while naming them. Programmers need not be descriptive but when it comes to being organised, hell yeah.

#### You can create your own issues.

#### Great place to start your code


#### Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.

#### Feel free to create a pull request. If it is not a spam, it will be accepted and sometimes merged.

#### Happy Coding!

## What is a pull request?
Pull requests helps you to let the maintainer of the project know the changes you want to make to their project. Once a pull request (PR) is opened
the project owner or the maintainers can review the changes and can merge them to their project or close the pr.

## How to Create a pull request?
Here we are going to create a pr with changes in the file.
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking on the fork button in the upper right corner of the page.
- Now there are **two ways for making changes to the file**
  ### Clone the project to your local environment and edit the file (recommended):
  
  FOR THIS YOU NEED GIT INSTALLED IN YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER
  - First of all click on the fork, top upper right button.
  - Click on "Clone or download" button in your forked repositories page.
  - Copy the web url.
  - Run `git clone CopiedWeburl` in the terminal of your local computer. After cloning is done move inside the cloned folder.
  - Go to  that folder.
  - Type your name, email and write into the file and save it.
  - In the terminal run 
    > git add . <br/>
    > git commit -m "Your Commit message" <br/>
    > git push origin master <br/>
  - Now return to the forked repository in GitHub in your browser and click on "New pull request" Button.
  - Type unique_title_name as the title of the pr and your name and email in the description box.
  - Click on "Create pull request" button and you are done!
